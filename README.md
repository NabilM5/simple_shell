# Simple Shell

A basic UNIX command interpreter developed as an integral component of ALX SE's low-level programming and algorithm track.


## Small Discription

Simple Shell is a lightweight interpreter for the UNIX command language. It is designed to read and interpret commands from various sources, such as files or standard input, and then execute those commands accordingly. It provides a basic yet functional interface for users to interact with the underlying operating system, allowing them to perform tasks, manage files, and run programs seamlessly. Simple Shell serves as a fundamental tool for executing commands and carrying out operations within a UNIX-based environment. It is often used for educational purposes and as a stepping stone for understanding more complex shell environments.
